# Final Project Planning Map

## 1. Project Idea I

In the UK, university students widely have discounts on different services, such as buying groceries or train tickets. There are several companies provide apps to let student to use promotion codes via their applications. However, such a one student, student status varies on different apps beacause of different verificaton dates. Graduated students can keep using these promotion apps even their student status has already expired for a year.

Therefore, I think the verification process can be re-designed and moved to Web 3, such as KYC process. It allows the blockchain to keep student status, and each promotion app can obtain student info from the blockchain and check the validity of each student status.

## 2. Project Idea II

(It is available to duplicate a existed project)

Recently, I do some research on DeFi and flashloan. There are a few interesting website such as [FURUCOMBO] and [EigenPhi]. FURUCOMBO allows users to build their own DeFi and execute it. EigenPhi visualises the workflows of sandwitch attack, liquidation, and flashloan.

## Why do you choose to do that?

Eg. To understand how DEXs operate business, to know how NFTs work on the blockchain.
